# Zookeeper

This project will help the zookeepers check on the animals and
make sure that they're doing well.

It will be able to process commands from the zookeepers and display
the animals in the terminal.

## Stage 1/4: Rush into print

This stage contains a simple program that will print a number of
messages to the output.

**Example:**
    The output:

    I love animals!
    Let's check on the animals...
    The deer looks fine.
    The bat looks happy.
    The lion looks healthy.

## Stage 2/4: Show me an animal!

One of the most important parts of working with animals is keeping an eye on them. 
We need to see the animals on the screen to know how they are doing, right? 

Now we are ready to print something awesome: an image of an animal!
